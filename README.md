Password-Generator



I Updated and Modified the password generator to When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first promoted for password length. If outside the range of 8-50, the user is prompted to once again enter a password length within the range. The prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number. The program then prompts the user to define if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask it to select at least each one and will loop back through the prompts. When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.



User Story AS AN employee with access to sensitive data I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security




Acceptance Criteria GIVEN I need a new, secure password WHEN I click the button to generate a password THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria WHEN prompted for password criteria THEN I select which criteria to include in the password WHEN prompted for the length of the password THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters WHEN I answer each prompt THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
